    <h1>Re:Eileen Dove university application</h1>
    <p>
        Dear Eileen, <br>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part
        of your <abbr title="PHD">PHD</abbr> next year. i will answer your question one by one, in the following
        sections. 
    </p>
    <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
    <p>
        We are happy to accommodate you Starting your study with us at any time however it will suit us better if you

    You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our websites
    </p>
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>
        At the Awesome science faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
        the kind of person we'd like on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by as
        follows, in order of priority:
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratol(..........)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of flunk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>c  (86<sup>0</sup>F
            farenheit) when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3.......</li>
        <li> <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="CSS">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores
        </li>
    </ol>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research
    to take, required staff and other resources, and anyting you'd think we need to know? Thanks.

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>
        Yes, you are right as part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
        question,my favourite dances are as follows, with defination:
    </p>
    <h3>polynesian chicken dance</h3>
    <p>
        A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as farr as 300BC, a whole village would dance
        around in a circle like chickens, to encurage their livestock to be "fruitful".
    </p>
    <h3>Icelabdic brownian shuffle</h3>
    <p>
        Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, wivh involved
        huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies and around in imperceptible tiny,
        very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that this dance inspired modern styles such as
        twerking.
    </p>
    <h3>Arctic robotic dance</h3>
    <p>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explora's in the 1960s believed to have discovered an
        new dance style charasterised by "robotic", stilted movements being practiced by inabitants of nothern alaska
        and canada. Later on however it was dicovered that they were just moving like this because they were really
        cold.
